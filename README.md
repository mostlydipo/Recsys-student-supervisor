# Recsys-student-supervisor
A recommendation system that matches students with supervisors based on project topic

## In an academic environment, pairing students with suitable supervisors is crucial for the successful completion of final projects. This project introduces an intuitive and efficient recommendation system to match students with potential supervisors based on the combined expertise and research areas of the supervisors. By employing a content-based filtering approach, the system utilizes the cosine similarity measure on vectorized textual data to recommend supervisors who are most aligned with a given project interest. Furthermore, the system provides an interactive user interface using the Streamlit framework, allowing users to search by multiple fields and receive relevant supervisor recommendations. This user-centric approach ensures that students find supervisors whose research and expertise best match their academic needs, thereby fostering a conducive environment for final project purposes
